# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As members, contributors, and leaders, we pledge to foster a harassment-free experience for everyone in our community. We welcome individuals of all ages, body sizes, visible or invisible disabilities, ethnicities, sex characteristics, gender identities and expressions, levels of experience, education, socio-economic statuses, nationalities, personal appearances, races, religions, and sexual identities and orientations.

We are committed to creating an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community, and we pledge to act and interact in ways that uphold these values.

## Our Standards

Behaviors that contribute to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards others
- Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Providing and graciously accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility and apologizing for mistakes, learning from the experience
- Prioritizing the well-being of the overall community over individual benefit

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are tasked with clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and extends to situations where individuals are representing the community in public spaces. Examples include using an official email address, posting from an official social media account, or acting as a community representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at dublokcom@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Community leaders are required to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
